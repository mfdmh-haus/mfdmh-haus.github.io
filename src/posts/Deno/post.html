  <h2>Deno!</h2>
  When I started working with Deno a few days ago, latest was v1.30.0. Now it's 1.30.3!
  Batteries included: TypeScript support, Package manager, Bundler, Watcher
  Secure by default
  Surprise! Deno Deploy's Deno is not the same as your local Deno. It's <a href="https://deno.com/deploy/docs/runtime-api">a subset of the stable APIs</a>.
  Favors Web standards over Node.js conventions: Supports but doesn't force you to use <a href="https://github.com/WICG/import-maps">import maps</a> as an alternative to NPM's package.json <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies">dependencies field</a> It does not have a built-in analog for devDependencies or peerDependencies. For something like that, they recommend <a href="https://deno.land/manual@v1.30.3/examples/manage_dependencies">this approach</a>.
